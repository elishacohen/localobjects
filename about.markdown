Local Objects [LO] is a journal featuring ordinary objects made and used in Korea. LO focuses on objectsâ€™ local identity in Korean society through stories of usage, language, history, aesthetics and materiality. By exploring connections between the cultural value of the object and its relevance to contemporary lifestyles, LO seeks and celebrates the meaning of locality in our hyper-globalized world.
